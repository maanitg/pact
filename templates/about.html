            <h6><strong>Can we create optimal student pairings based on music taste alone?</strong> <br><br>
                
                Wavelength is  inspired by <a href="https://marriagepact.com/">Marriage Pact</a>, a project spun into a company by two Stanford students and now at colleges across the country.
                Once a year, Marriage Pact asks students to fill out a questionnaire on their personalities and preferences, and finds the optimal pairings
                of students on a given campus.<br><br>

                But what if we tried to pair students on a single, defining factor - music taste!<br><br>

                <a href="/">Login</a> with your Stanford.edu email, fill out a quick form and connect your Spotify,
                and be  matched with another Stanford student based on music taste compatibility.<br><br>

                We'll send you an email when matches have been made. From there, what you do with your optimal music match is up to you. <br><br>
                
                Who knows, maybe you'll be on the same wavelength. <br><br>
