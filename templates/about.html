        <h2>About Wavelength</h2>

                <h6>Wavelength is  inspired by Marriage Pact, a project spun into a company by two Stanford students and now at colleges across the country.
                    Once a year, Marriage Pact asks students to fill out a questionnaire on their personalities and preferences, and finds the optimal pairings
                    of students on a given campus.<br>

                    But why not try pairing students on something more targeted - music taste!<br>

                    Wavelength is a student project for exactly this. Login with your Stanford email, connect your Spotify account,
                    and be  matched with another student on campus based on music taste compatibility.<br> 
                    
                    Can we create optimal pairings based on music taste alone? We'll find out.<br>

                    All you have to do, is <a href="/">create an account</a> with your stanford.edu email, fill out a one-time form, login with Spotify, and... wait. 
                    We'll send you an email when matches have been made. From there, what you do with your optimal music match is up to you. <br>
                    
                    Who knows, maybe you'll find each other to be on the same wavelength. <br>
